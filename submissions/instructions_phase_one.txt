I have a larger project. I will be completing it in phases.
This is phase 1. I will need additional phases
after this.

Ad Submisssion Software PHP Mysql

Submits Ads to Bestplumberfortlauderdale.com

1. Create sign up for customer profile.

2. Customer Profile should have these fields.

Name
Email

3. Within customer profile the customer
needs to be able to create an "Ad Campaign
Profile"

The Ad Campaign Profile Needs the following Fields.

Campaign Email
Campaign Password
Title
Description
Website
Keywords
Facebook Page
Affiliate Link
YouTube Url
Address
Phone
City Area
Category
Image 1
Image 2
Image 3
Number of ads to submit

4. Then the software needs to be able
to submit the ad in the Campaign Profile
to random US cities on www.bestplumberfortlauderdale.com


I can pay $100.US for this specific project.
We can then continue to develop this
software with other projects.

This is just the basic script. I will want
more features. But I thought best to take one
step at a time.
